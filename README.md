# Deep-Learning

#This repository is about deep learning using Keras and tensorflow.

The Full_DeepLearning files are using tensorflow while other files include Examples of deep learning through Keras.

# 1. Churn Rate Modelling
 It is about the rate of people leaving a company. This includes Modelling Dense NN through Keras. Applying CV through SKlearn and Keras.
 Also it provides an intutive way of finding best parameters for Deep NN through Grid Search.
 
 # 2. Convolutional Deep Network
 
This file is for beginners who are starting in Deep Learning. It explains simple implementation of CNN for classification of Cats and Dogs.

# 3. LSTM-RNN

THis file is also beginners guide to LSTM-RNN using Keras.
